### Theming

Onsen UI style can be easily modified in a variety of ways. Here are the most common options.

#### Modifiers

A modifier is a cross-component way to provide customizability for Onsen UI components in the shape of custom attributes. When a component is defined with a modifier, it will have a separate class namespace so that you can apply custom styles to the component. Some components have several easy to use preset modifiers to change the appearance.

For example, each of the following buttons have a different look. To change modifiers dynamically, please manipulate modifier attribute from JavaScript.

```
<ons-button modifier="quiet">Quiet</ons-button>
<ons-button modifier="light">Light</ons-button>
<ons-button modifier="large">Large</ons-button>
<ons-button modifier="cta">Call To Action</ons-button>
<ons-button modifier="material">Material Design</ons-button>
```

For further information, please have a look at [this article](https://onsen.io/blog/creating-custom-modifiers/).

#### Cross Platform Styling (Autostyling)

Onsen UI components are automatically styled depending on the platform where the app runs. You can easily test this feature with your browser Dev Tools by switching between iOS and Android views or by appending `?platform=android` or `?platform=ios` as a query string to the URL.

Automatic styling simply applies `modifier="material"` to the components when `ons.platform.isAndroid()` is true. You can disable this feature by running `ons.disableAutoStyling()` right after including `onsenui.js` (i.e. before the app is initialized). If you disable it you may need to manually specify `modifier="material"` in every component you want to display with Material Design. You can also specify `disable-auto-styling` attribute in specific components that you don't want to auto style.

Some tools are provided to give a more accurate customization.

##### Platform utilities

[`ons.platform`](/v2/api/js/ons.platform.html) object is available with methods such as `ons.platform.isIOS()`, `ons.platform.isWebView()`, etc.

You can set a platform with `ons.platform.select('android')`, for example, in order to display Material Design on every platform. This must be called before the app is initialized (right after including `onsenui.js`).

##### Conditional element

A conditional element called [`ons-if`](/v2/api/js/ons-if.html) is available to filter content depending on the platform or orientation.

> `<ons-if>` component is not available for React and Vue bindings.

```html
  <ons-if platform="android">
    This is Android
  </ons-if>
  <ons-if platform="ios other">
    This is NOT Android
  </ons-if>
```

With this, for example, you can display [`ons-fab`](/v2/api/js/ons-fab.html) for Material Design and other type of button for iOS flat design.

AngularJS 1 bindings also provide [`ons-if-platform`](/v2/api/angular1/ons-if-platform.html) for this purpose:

```html
<div ons-if-platform="android">
  This is Android
</div>
```

##### Icons shortcut

[`ons-icon`](/v2/api/js/ons-icon.html) provides a shortcut to make auto styling easier:

```html
<ons-icon icon="ion-navicon, material:md-menu" size="24px, material:20px"></ons-icon>
```

The second icon will be displayed when `material` modifier is present (other modifiers can be used).

#### Applying Styles to Inner Custom Elements

Some Onsen UI components expand their content during runtime. For instance, `ons-page` automatically injects the following code inside
`<ons-page>` and `</ons-page>`.

```
<ons-page class="page">
  <div class=”page__background”></div>
  <div class=”page__content”><!-- Your page content --></div>
</ons-page>
```

Therefore, sometimes you might need to style components using this inner elements. For example, changing background color of a specific page could be done with `#myPage .page__background` CSS selector.

See also [Components Compilation](compilation.html) section for more details about this.

#### Animations

Onsen UI already provides multiple built-in animations for its routing components and dialogs. However, it is also possible to create custom animations for specific components or even [extend existing animations](/v2/guide/extend.html#extending-animators) and change part of them. This is a relatively advanced topic since it requires digging a bit in Onsen UI core code.

##### Animit

Onsen UI relies on [Animit](https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/blob/master/core/src/ons/animit.js), a minimal animation library for managing CSS transtions on mobile browsers.

Animit can be accessed with `ons.animit` or `import { animit } from ons;`, depending on the type of the app. It exposes methods to queue CSS animations, apply delays and run callbacks as follows:

```javascript
let animation1 = animit(myElement) // This defines the animation for the provided element
  .saveStyle() // Saves the original style of the element
  .queue({ // Original position/style in the animation
    css: {
      transform: 'translate3D(0, 100%, 0)'
    },
    duration: 0
  })
  .wait(0.2) // Delay applied before the transition starts
  .queue({ // Next step in the animation
    css: {
      transform: 'translate3D(0, 0, 0)',
    },
    duration: 0.6,
    timing: 'linear'
  })
  .restoreStyle() // Restores the original style of the element
  .queue(done => { // Optional "On transition end" callback
    callback();
    done();
  }
);

animation1.play(); // Run the animation
```

Since Animit modifies the element's `style` property, it provides `saveStyle()` and `restoreStyle()` methods to ensure the previous styles are not lost. `queue({css: {...}, duration: 0, timing: 'linear'})` or `queue({...}, {duration: 0, timing: 'linear'})` method is provided to add transitions to the queue. The first one will be the first style applied in the animation that will transition into the following styles. In the provided example, we are moving a new page inside the view from right to left. Therefore, it needs to start at position `translate3d(0, 100%, 0)` and move to `translate3d(0, 0, 0)`. Method `wait(...)` can be used to apply a delay between transitions. Finally, we can optionally call `queue(function(done) { ...; done(); })` again to run a callback if necessary.

It is also possible to pass an array of HTML elements to `animit` if performing the same animation on multiple elements is required: `animit([el1, el2]).saveStyle()...`.

It is very common to have more than one animation running at the same time. `animit.runAll(animation1, animation2, animation3);` method can be used for this behavior instead of `animation1.play(); animation2.play(); animation3.play();`.

##### Creating animators

Animators can be created from scratch by extending the necessary animator classes that Onsen UI provides. Every component exposes a minimum animator interface that must be extended and implemented: `NavigatorTransitionAnimator`, `AlertDialogAnimator`, `DialogAnimator`, `PopoverAnimator`, `ModalAnimator`, `TabbarAnimator` and `SplitterAnimator`. This is the desired way to implement animators if you want to build a custom version of Onsen UI or want to make a pull request to the repository. For more information, please have a look at the [existing animators](https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/tree/master/core/src/elements) for every component.

ES2015 (ES6) is preffered but not strictly required for this to work. An example in ES5 can be found [here](https://codepen.io/frankdiox/pen/kXJvQL?editors=1010).
