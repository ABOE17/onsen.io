### Page Lifecycle

`<ons-page>` provides a set of DOM events that will be fired in unique and set times of its life cycle. Use these events to alter the behavior on each page.

- **init event** is fired after <ons-page> is attached to DOM. Use this event to initialize the code or dynamic content of a page when it is created.
- **destroy event** is fired before <ons-page> is destroyed and prior to DOM detachment. Use this event to clean up or save anything you need.
- **show event** is fired every time <ons-page> comes into view, i.e. when a new page is created and shown immediately or when an existing page shows up. Use this event to run code every time a page appears.
- **hide event** is fired every time <ons-page> disappears from view, i.e. when a visible page is destroyed or is hidden but still exists in the page stack. Use this event to run code every time a page disappears.

Page lifecycle events will be propagated to the page’s descendants so they are correspondingly shown, hidden, or destroyed. For example, destroying <ons-navigator> will throw hide event only for the displayed page (navigator’s top page) and destroy event for every page in navigator’s page stack.

```
<ons-page id="page1">This is a blank page</ons-page>
 
<script>
document.addEventListener('init', function(event) {
  if (event.target.matches('#page1')) {
    ons.notification.alert('Page 1 is initiated.');
    // Set up content...
  }
}, false);
</script>
 ```
