### Introduction

#### What is Onsen UI?

#### Displaying components

Inside the `<body>` and `</body>` tags of `index.html`, enter the following code:

```html
<ons-button>Click me</ons-button>
```

Save and preview the app, and a button with the text 'Click me' will be shown (as in figure N).

_TODO IMAGE_

By using HTML tags beginning with `ons-`, we can display the elements provided by Onsen UI. These elements, such as ons-button, are called __components__.

From here on, we will learn how to work with components, examining various components along the way.

##### Attributes

Enter the following code:

```html
<ons-range></ons-range>
```

Save and preview, and a bar with a handle will be displayed (figure N).

_TODO IMAGE_

This is the `ons-range` component. It is used when you want the user to select a value ranging from 0 to 100. For example, it could be used for an app's volume setting.

Depending on the situation, you might want to set an initial value for the slider. To do this, change the opening `<ons-range>` tag in the following way:

```html
<ons-range value="80"></ons-range>
```

The handle now appears close to the right edge of the bar.

_TODO IMAGE_

This is the result of setting ons-range's `value` attribute to 80. If the value attribute is set to 0, the handle appears at the leftmost edge of the bar; if it is set to 100, the handle appears at the rightmost edge.

In this way, we can alter the appearance and behavior of an Onsen UI component __by setting its attributes__.

Rather than just simply displaying components, one of the main points of developing applications with Onsen UI is that __you can use attributes appropriately according to the situation__.
No matter how complex a component is, fundamentally you are always fine-tuning its appearance and behavior by altering its attributes.

##### The `modifier` attribute

Enter the following code:

```html
<ons-button>(default)</ons-button>
<ons-button modifier="outline">outline</ons-button>
<ons-button modifier="quiet">quiet</ons-button>
<ons-button modifier="light">light</ons-button>
<ons-button modifier="cta">cta</ons-button>
```

Save and preview, and five buttons with various different appearances are displayed (figure N).

_TODO IMAGE_

In this example, we are using the special `modifier` attribute, which is one part of an Onsen UI component.
By utilizing the modifier attribute, we can alter the appearance of a component in various ways.

> `modifier` can be given several values at once.
> These values are separated by spaces like this:
> `<ons-list-item modifier="longdivider chevron">Item</ons-list-item>`.
> However, be careful of using values from the same family: they can clash, resulting in strange behavior.

__modifier is just a normal attribute__, but it plays a very important role in Onsen UI applications, and we will be using it frequently from here on.

##### Combining components

Now let's see how to combine several Onsen UI components.

Enter the following code:

```html
<ons-list-title>List 1</ons-list-title>
<ons-list>
  <ons-list-header>Category A</ons-list-header>
  <ons-list-item>Item 1</ons-list-item>
  <ons-list-item>Item 2</ons-list-item>
  <ons-list-item>Item 3</ons-list-item>
  <ons-list-header>Category B</ons-list-header>
  <ons-list-item>Item 4</ons-list-item>
  <ons-list-item>Item 5</ons-list-item>
</ons-list>
```

Save and preview, and a list appears looking something like an app's settings screen or similar (figure N)

_TODO IMAGE_

As shown by this example, we can use Onsen UI to __neatly line up and nest__ components.
To get multiple components to work together properly, __there are some fixed rules that must be followed__.

For example, here the ons-list-title component appears directly above ons-list.
In order for this to happen, we had to place the ons-list-title tag immediately before the ons-list tag in the code.
On the other hand, the ons-list-header and ons-list-item components appear inside the ons-list component.
Therefore the ons-list-header and ons-list-item tags need to be placed inside the ons-list tag in the code.

__If components are combined incorrectly, the display will fall apart or the components will behave strangely.__
For example, if you place ons-list-item outside ons-list, or ons-list-header inside ons-list-item, the display will be glitchy.
If you have used components in combination and the display is coming out wrong, check your code against the sample code in this book or the Onsen UI website.

#### What is Onsen UI?

Onsen UI is...

- A large set of rich **UI components** specifically designed for mobile apps
- Packed with ready-to-implement features following **native iOS and Android design standards**
- Free to use, **100% open source** software ([Apache v2 license](https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/blob/master/LICENSE))

Onsen UI enriches app users' mobile experience with natively designed UI elements. It's perfect for developing hybrid apps using Cordova or developing mobile web apps (also referred to as [Progressive Web Apps](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/)). For more information on these types of implementation, see [Deploy to PWA & Cordova](/v2/guide/deploy.html#deploying-your-app).

##### Future-Proof Architecture

Under the hood, Onsen UI consists of three layers:

1. **CSS Components**, written in [cssnext](http://cssnext.io/), the next generation of CSS
2. **Web Components**, written in native JavaScript to **support ALL frameworks**
3. **Framework Bindings**, created for tighter integration with popular frameworks such as [Vue.js](vue), [AngularJS 1](angular1), [Angular 2+](angular2), and [React](react)

In a nutshell, Onsen UI simplifies your development, works with any framework, and is **future proof**!

Interested in a deep dive? Check out our [Onsen UI Architecture](architecture.html) section.

##### What's Included (Kitchensink)

Here you can try out the majority of Onsen UI's components in a quick sample demo app (kitchen sink app). The two apps below are actually sharing the same source code but are styled to fit their respective platforms using the [Auto Styling](theming.html#auto-styling) feature.

<iframe class="tutorial-embed" width="100%" height="568" src="<%- @getTutorialUrl "embed-compact", "vanilla/common_patterns/kitchensink", false %>"></iframe>

For those interested in the complete list of components, please take a look at the [CSS Components](../api/css.html) and the [Web Components](../api/js).

##### Browser and Device Support

Onsen UI is fully optimized and tested for the following platforms.

- Mobile
  - **iOS 8 and up**
  - **Android 4.4.4 and up** with WebView or Chrome browser
    (Android 4.0 and up with [Crosswalk engine](https://crosswalk-project.org/))
- Desktop
  - Latest version of Safari browser
  - Latest version of Chrome browser

For other platforms, please be aware that some components or features may not work correctly. Please see [Old Browser Support](/v2/guide/faq.html#old-browsers) for details.

#### The First Onsen UI App

Now that youâ€™re familiar with what Onsen UI is all about, it's time to start creating your own app. For quicker installation, let's use the CDN served files.
First, create a file called `index.html` and paste the following HTML.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/onsenui/css/onsenui.css">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/onsenui/css/onsen-css-components.min.css">
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/onsenui/js/onsenui.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <ons-button onclick="alert('Hello World!')">Click Me</ons-button>
</body>
</html>
```

<img src="/images/guide/first_onsen_ui_app.png" style="border: 1px solid #ccc;">

While this may be rudimentary, this example contains some important aspects of Onsen UI components as below.
- You need to include two CSS files (`onsenui.css` and `onsen-css-components.min.css`) and one JavaScript file (`onsenui.min.js`).
- In the code above, `<ons-button>` component is used. It is our custom tag that represents a button. All Onsen UI branded components have the `ons-` prefix.
- Like other standard tags (or HTML elements), Onsen UI components have attributes (in this case `onclick`), methods and event listeners. Read more in [Attributes, Properties, Methods and Events](/v2/guide/fundamentals.html#attributes-properties-methods-and-events).

Congratulations! You've covered all the basics to get started. Now find Onsen UI components (i.e. `<ons-input>`, `<ons-icon>`, `<ons-carousel>`...) from [our collection](../api/js), and put them in your app. It's that simple.

>Tips on native alert: You may have noticed, default `alert()` function does not fit with native app design. Therefore, Onsen UI provides [`ons.notification`](../api/js/ons.notification.html) object for dialogs. Try replacing `alert` with `ons.notification.alert`!

#### Making Your Web & Hybrid App Feel Native

Even though an app may emulate the visual components of iPhone or Android, the goal of a seamless app is to ensure that touch & feel also meets users' expectations. That's where the users feel the "uncanny valley".

To fill the gap, Onsen UI gives you the ability to simulate things like page transition animations and the ripple effect, and gives genuine and high quality feeling to your app. Such details make a huge difference.

<iframe class="tutorial-embed" width="100%" height="568" src="<%- @getTutorialUrl "embed-compact", "vanilla/reference/navigator", false %>"></iframe>

In the above example, there are two pages defined by `<ons-page>` component. Then, `<ons-navigator>` component provides native-like page transition. If you want to make your app more native-like, please proceed to [Fundamentals](/v2/guide/fundamentals.html) to learn how to fully utilize the details.

In Onsen UI, everything from visual widgets to small details are carefully crafted to help your application look fully native.
