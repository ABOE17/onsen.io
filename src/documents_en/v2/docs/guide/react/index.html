Note: We are using ES6 + JSX and transpile using Browserify and Babel in the following examples. You might want to read through [React document]() for more details.

### Onsen UI HelloWorld with React

To get started, let's create a simple Hello World application. The following sample code is a React version of Onsen UI HelloWorld.

``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/onsenui.css">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/onsen-css-components.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="app"></div>
  </body>
  <script>
    var App = React.createClass({
      render: function() {
        return (
          <Ons.Page>
            <div>Hello World!</div>
            <Ons.Button />
          </Ons.Page>
        );
      }
    });
    ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('app'));
  </script>
</html>
```

This example is loading the following JS libraries, react.js, react-dom.js, onsen.js and react-onsen.js. For stylesheets, it is loading onsenui.css and onsen-css-components.css which are bundled in Onsen UI distribution package. To know the details about Onsen UI stylesheets, please refer to our [Style Sheets Guide](#TODO) document.

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/onsenui.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/onsen-css-components.css">
```

In `<body>` tag, there is only a `<div>` tag having `app` id. This is where React will render the content into, and you can see it in the very bottom of JS code.

Also notice `<script>` tag has `jsx`(#TODO) type. This means this script is not a pure JavaScript that browser supports (most commonly [EcmaScript 5](#TODO)), but is a EcmaScript 6 with JSX format #TODO. [Babel](#TODO) will transpile this code into EcmaScript 5 in the browser. To get better performance, we can use node.js to transpile the code. Please read [Setup node.js to transpile React app](#TODO) for details.

``` js
var App = React.createClass({
  render: function() {
  }
});
```

Inside the script, `React.createClass()` function defines a React Class (#Not a component?) called `App`. It has one property called `render`, and this is the function that is called when the app is rendered. The returning object is described in [JSX](#TODO), which is a XML like language to represent React Virtual DOM(#correct?). In this case, it is returning `<Ons.Page>` component that has `<div>` and `<Ons.Button`> component.

``` js
return (
  <Ons.Page>
    <div>Hello World!</div>
    <Ons.Button />
  </Ons.Page>
);
```

As you can see in this example, all `<Ons.*>` components are React Components, and they are loaded by react-onsenui.js. Click here to see our full [Onsen UI React Components Reference](#TODO#).

Putting together, when index.html is loaded into the browser, it will compile JSX code, inject into the body, and renders the content.

This is a basic introduction of how Onsen UI and React works together. If you want to further learn React, we recommend to read their official [React Tutorial](#TODO).

### Loading Onsen UI for React

Onsen UI for React is an extension to Onsen UI core, a Web components based UI framework. You need to load the following two JavaScript modules.

- Onsen UI Core ([GitHub](https://github.com/onsenui/onsen.io))
- Onsen UI for React Extension ([GitHub](https://github.com/onsenui/react-onsenui))

You can load with a normal `<script>` tag as follows:

``` html
<script src="react.js"></script>
<script src="react-dom.js"></script>
<script src="onsen.js"></script>
<script src="react-onsen.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/babel-core/6.1.19/browser.min.js"></script>
```

Or, you can use React and Onsen UI from npm with CommonJS module system like Browserify or Webpack. In this case, use the `onsenui` and `react-onsenui` packages, in addition to `react` and `react-dom` npm packages. In the example below `ons` contains Onsen UI core instance, and `Ons` contains React components.

```
var React = require('react');
var ReactDOM = require('react-dom');
var ons = require('onsen');
var Ons = require('react-onsen');
```

Alternatively, you can also use `import()` to specify the modules you want to use in `react-onsen` pacakge.

```
import {Page, Toolbar, Button} from 'react-onsenui';
```

To see the instructions and more details, please visit [Introduction to Onsen UI with React](#TODO).

### Event Handling

Onsen UI components are capable of handling React [SyntheticEvent](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/events.html) events. For instance, you can catch a tap event by using `onClick` event handler, or the text box change by `onChange` event handler.

The following example describes how to get events that are native to React.

``` javascript
class MyPage extends React.Component {
  handleClick() {
    ons.notification.alert('Hello, world!');
  }
  render() {
    return() (
      <Page>
         <Button onClick={this.handleClick}>Click me!</Button>
      </Page>
    );
  }
}
```
