<%- @markdown => %>

Onsen UI is a complete Web Components driven UI framework for hybrid (aka. [Cordova](http://cordova.io) / [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com)) apps. It also is equipped with popular JS frameworks support, including [AngularJS 1](/v2/docs/guide/angular1/), [Angular 2+](/v2/docs/guide/angular2/) and [React](/v2/docs/guide/react/). Although they are using the same core, we are optimizing the APIs for each framework.

This guide provides the basic concepts of Onsen UI. For more information about specific components, please see the reference section. A live example is included in each reference page with extended examples and information.

### Download via npm or bower
