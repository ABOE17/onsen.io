# How things is put together

In Onsen UI, everything is tag. 


## Page management

Onsen UI provides some tags for managing pages and its transition animation. Those tags include screen, navigator, tabbar, and sliding-menu. Each have different UI and page placeholders. For illustration, see how to use navigator below.


### How to use navigator

Navigator provides a toolbar and a page placeholder. The toolbar has left button, right button, and title accessible via attributes. E.g. to set the title to "Page 1", we would write:

    <ons-navigator title="Page 1"/>
