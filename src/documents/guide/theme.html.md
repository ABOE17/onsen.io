## Working with Themes

Onsen UI offers several themes to provide different styles for the UI components. App developers can choose a theme that best fits your app.

This page will describe how to use the Onsen UI themes.

### Available Themes

Onsen UI currently has three available themes:

 * ios7
 * android4_4
 * onsen

### Changing Themes

Onsen UI provides each theme in a single CSS file. All you need to do to switch the theme is change the CSS file when loading it with the HTML.

    ...

### Applying Dynamic Themes

You can also change themes dynamically, specific to the device or browser currently running the app.

	...

### Expanding Themes

You can expand on existing themes by overwriting styles with CSS, just as you would do with a normal web page.

Please refer to the theme customization section of the <a href="/guide/cutomize.html">Customize</a> page for details.
