Dear followers, we happy to announce that we will attend [O'Reilly Fluent Conference 2015](http://fluentconf.com/javascript-html-2015), next week! For those that never heard about it, the O'Reilly Fluent Conference is an event for developers working with JavaScript, HTML5, and other web technologies. Fluent covers the full scope of the Web Platform and its associated technologies, including WebGL, CSS3, mobile APIs, Node.js, AngularJS, ECMAScript 6, and more.
