### Monaca HTML5 Resource Encryption

This plugin provides a cryptographic method for securing the source code of your HTML5 applications. We are using AES encryption which is an algorithm for encrypting data. Your HTML5 source code will be converted into a binary code and the encryption algorithm will be applied. This plugin is not doing a simple obfuscation of your source code but it is applying a real encryption to your application. This security measure will prevent anyone from seeing your source code or stealing your work.

### Monaca Secure Storage

Most people should have a certain expectation of privacy if they are using cloud technologies or transfering files over the internet. Other people shouldn't be able to see or access their files. Nobody wants his or her data to be compromised or stolen. It is always a good practice to keep your content secured. With this plugin there is no need anymore for users to pay for expensive services or applications to encrypt their data. This plugin provides the functionality to encrypt your data storage. If the application is uninstalled all the saved data will also be deleted.
