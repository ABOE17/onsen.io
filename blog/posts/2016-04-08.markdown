### Monaca HTML5 Resource Encryption

[Monaca HTML5 Resource Encryption plugin](https://docs.monaca.io/en/reference/third_party_phonegap/html5_resource_encryption/) provides the ability to encrypt HTML5 assets. Moreover, it allows to decrypt the previously encrypted assets directly on runtime. In order to implement such as features, the encryption is provided by [AES-256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) algorithm. Once the HTML5 source code has been converted into binary code, the algorithm is executed, providing the maximum level of security for your resources. This security measure will prevent anyone from seeing your source code or stealing your work, a key feature in today's development environment.

### Monaca Secure Storage

Most users have big expectations for what concerns privacy, in particular when they are using cloud technologies or transferring files over the internet. How will the data be managed on the backend? Will they be accessible to untrusted sources? Nobody wants its own data to be compromised, that's why it's always a good practice to keep content secured. With [Monaca Secure Storage plugin](https://docs.monaca.io/en/reference/third_party_phonegap/secure_storage/) there is no need anymore to pay for expensive services in order to encrypt data and storage. Monaca Secure Storage plugin provides the perfect solution, allowing the developers to fully encrypt the data storage in an automatic way. If the application will be uninstalled, all the saved data will also be deleted, allowing to preserve user's privacy.

### Monaca In-App Updater

As most of the mobile developers know, sometimes the app publishing process can be tough and require time before the submission gets processed. This can lead to business revenue loss and stress, that's why we decided to develop and integrate an In-App Updater feature into Monaca.
[Monaca In-App Updater plugin](https://docs.monaca.io/en/reference/third_party_phonegap/in-app_updater/) allows updating HTML5 assets contained in the app without any need to rebuild and package every time. This plugin is designed to boost your app development process while providing the comfort of easily update your application with the minimum effort. The only requirement is a Web server to host the updated files which will be accessed by the app. No more need to wait for your app submission approval, the updates will be immediately available to the final user, which can immediately start to take advantage of the new features and content.

### Monaca In-App Purchases

Last but not least, we decided to introduce In-App Purchase plugin to open new business possibilities for mobile app developers. It greatly improves the profits by offering the users the opportunity to buy content (like additional turns in a game, different background themes, etc.) directly from the application, taking advantage of payment services like [Google Wallet](https://wallet.google.com/), [Apple Pay](www.apple.com/apple-pay/
) etc. Monaca In-App Purchases works great in combination with In-App Updater, allowing to immediately monetize new app content and features.
