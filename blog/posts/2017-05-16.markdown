You may have happened to read our [last blog post](https://onsen.io/blog/onsenui-recent-updates-may-2017/) about some of the progress we have reached lately in Onsen UI. Well *surprise surprise*, that's not all.

We want to take our hybrid app framework one step further, so besides all those recent updates about stability improvement in iOS and so on, we have **brand new core components** that you can start using right away.

Keep reading if you'd like to get acquainted with these new components.

### Action sheet

You are probably familiar with those sheets sliding up from the bottom of the screen and prompting user action, much like dialogs. From `Action sheets` of *iOS* and `Bottom sheets` of *Android*, behold the `ons-action-sheet`.

Coupled to `ons-action-sheet` there is also another new component `ons-action-sheet-button` that you can use to create those nice action buttons inside your action sheets. Here is a typical use case template:

``` html
<ons-action-sheet id="sheet">
  <ons-action-sheet-button icon="md-square-o">Label</ons-action-sheet-button>
  <ons-action-sheet-button icon="md-square-o" modifier="destructive">Delete Label</ons-action-sheet-button>
  <ons-action-sheet-button icon="md-close">Cancel</ons-action-sheet-button>
</ons-action-sheet>
```

Being a dialog it is naturally hidden by default and you need to open it programatically. For brevity I recommend you check the [tutorial](tutorial link) for an example on how to do that in the different platforms.

You can also create and open an action sheet dynamically with the method `ons.openActionSheet` (which btw is also done in the tutorial above). To create the same sheet as in the example above the code would be:

``` javascript
ons.openActionSheet({
  id: 'sheet',
  buttons: [
    {
      label: 'Label',
      icon: 'md-square-o'
    },
    {
      label: 'Delete Label',
      icon: 'md-square-o',
      modifier: 'destructive'
    },
    {
      label: 'Cancel',
      icon: 'md-close'
    }
  ]
})
```

### Card

Want to show some nice pieces of information in a stylish fashion without too much CSS work? The component you are looking for is the new `ons-card`.

![Card](/blog/content/images/2017/May/card.png)

With it you get a highlighted box in which you can insert any type of content you wish. We provide special classes `title` and `content` to make style separation even simpler. Typical use case:

``` html
<ons-card>
  <div class="title">Title</div>
  <div class="content">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.</div>
</ons-card>
```

Of course a card will be richer if you add other media content such as images to it or mix it up with other Onsen UI components. We even have the open possibility of adding other predefined building blocks (e.g. [the ones here](https://material.io/guidelines/components/cards.html#cards-content-blocks)) so please let us know if you think that would be nice to have.

### Toast

Yet another new dialog is provided by `ons-toast`. Use it when you want to pass a subtler message to the user notifying him that something happened and optionally prompting for an action but allowing the normal app flow to continue.

![Toast](/blog/content/images/2017/May/toast.png)

Here is a way in which you can define a toast dialog:

``` html
<ons-toast>
  Message Message Message Message<button>Action</button>
</ons-toast>
```

refer to [documentation](ons.notification docs) for details

### Search input
