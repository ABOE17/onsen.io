![Title](/blog/content/images/2017/Feb/star.png)

A couple of months ago we published an article on [how to create a Pokedex application](/blog/tutorial-how-to-create-pokemon-app-using-angular2-cli/) using Angular 2. Since then, the stable version of Angular 2 has been released and we have released the RC version of our [Angular 2 bindings](/angular2/).

In this article we will use Onsen UI 2 and Angular 2 to create a simple mobile Pokedex app. We will use some of the code from the previous article, but we will integrate it with Onsen UI. We will also take a look at the [Monaca CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/monaca), which is a great tool for creating, debugging, and developing apps with Angular 2 and Onsen UI.

## Conclusion

In this article we have created a very simple Pokedex app using Angular 2 and Onsen UI 2. Even if this Pokedex app doesn't display a lot of information, we hope you can see how it could be expanded into a more complete app by adding more pages to the navigator and adding more information from the PokeAPI. The Angular 2 bindings for Onsen UI are currently in RC stage but we are getting closer to a stable version.

Onsen UI is an open source library used to create the UI of hybrid apps. You can find more information on our [GitHub page](https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI). If you like Onsen UI, please don't forget to give us a star! ★★★★★
