![Onsen UI and Vue.js](https://onsen.io/blog/content/images/2016/Aug/onsen_vue.png)

In [a previous article](https://onsen.io/blog/onsen-ui-vue-2/) we introduced how to use the Onsen UI components directly from Vue.js 2.

We are now updating a Vue.js binding for Onsen UI called `vue-onsenui` in order to support Vue.js 2.
In this article we announce its release schedule and the development status.

<!-- more -->

## Release schedule

The Vue.js 2 compatible version of `vue-onsenui` has not yet been published on npm.
~~For the time being it is available only from the [`vue2` branch](https://github.com/OnsenUI/OnsenUI/tree/vue2/bindings/vue) of our GitHub repository.~~
<span style="opacity: 0.6">(As of February 16, 2017, `vue-onsenui` is available from `npm install vue-onsenui`)</span>

Publications on npm are scheduled as follows:

|Phase|Version|Detail|Release date of initial version|
|-|-|-|-|
|Alpha|`2.0.0-alpha.0`|In this phase, we implement minimum features. **We will make many breaking changes.**|Soon|
|Beta|`2.0.0-beta.0`|In this phase, we implement optional features and brush up the API. **We will make some breaking changes.**|In February|
|RC|`2.0.0-rc.0`|In this phase, we mainly fix bugs. We will not make any breaking changes.|TBD|
|Stable|`2.0.0`|We will not make any breaking changes.|TBD|

Any time we publish a new version we will announce it in this blog, in our Twitter account and remaining channels.

We recommend that you subscribe to our [Blog RSS Feed](https://onsen.io/blog/rss.xml) and follow us at [@Onsen_UI](https://twitter.com/Onsen_UI).

## `v-ons-*` components

`vue-onsenui` is going to provide Vue components named `v-ons-*`, each of which wraps the corresponding `ons-*` element.

With `v-ons-*` components you can write your Vue.js app even more easily than using the `ons-*` elements directly.

## Development status

As of January 19 we have the following components in `vue-onsenui`:

|Name|Type|Status|Detail|

|**Page**|Page|Implemented as `v-ons-page`, `v-ons-toolbar`, `v-ons-bottom-toolbar`, `v-ons-toolbar-button`||
