And finally it is here, more hybrid and cross-platform than ever: your mobile apps developed with Onsen UI are now able to run on Windows Phone platform!

Miscrosoft's platform is getting popular and it is expectable to rise its numbers when Windows 10 arrives, and Onsen UI will help you to reach this market with the same effort than creating apps for the already present Android and iOS. Why just score two points when you can get three with just one hit!

[Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) officially supports Windows Universal platform since there is an increasing number of developers, so in Onsen UI we decided that it was time to support this emerging platform as well. Of course, Windows has historically been *slighly* hard to support in the same way than the other main platforms, but we are making great effort to overcome this gap.

Up to date we have fixed many incompatibilities that made applications crash in Windows Universal, and we are currently solving glitches and minor misbehavior that may occur in some situations with certain elements, but the bulk of the process is already done! In the incoming weeks we will keep testing (and, hopefully, receiving feedback from you!) in order to make apps in Windows Phone feel as smooth as in Android or iOS.

We will provide soon a document containing all the known issues related to Windows Universal app development with Onsen UI. We are confident to fix all of it with the help of the community and make Onsen UI a great bet for cross-platform applications!
