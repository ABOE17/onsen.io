title: "Onsen UI now has partial support for Windows Universal Apps!"
---

As you know, Onsen UI has been created mainly to improve the development of apps based on [Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/). Since Apace Cordova officially supports Windows platform and, since a large portion of developers, that use Onsen UI to implement the user interface of their apps, have expressed they interest of making their apps available also for Windows Universal platform, we have decided that was time, for us, to support also this emerging platform. We strongly support the concept of Hybrid App, that's why we want to give, to everybody, the possibility to use our product on all the main platforms available on the market, despite their market share. For us, the Windows support is just a natural step in this direction.

Actually, we are able only to provide a partial support for Windows Universal platform. There is still a couple of elements that are not working properly and, some animations, are still not smooth as in Android and iOS, but we are confident that there will be improvements in the future. We will release soon a document containing all the issues related to Windows Universal app development with Onsen UI.
Since the release of Windows 10 is planned for this summer, the have planned to offer full support only when it will be available on the market.
