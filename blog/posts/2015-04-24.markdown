We are releasing a set of **Cordova + Onsen UI templates** prepared to run on [Windows Phone 8.1](/windows-phone-8-1-tutorial/), so we finally have a reference to develop in this platform using Onsen UI. These templates follow the Cordova App pattern, what means that they appropriate for **Cordova CLI** but also for the new **Visual Studio 2015**, as we will explain in this post. And to top it off, these templates are also available for [TypeScript](type-definitions-onsenui-typescript/)!

The templates include working versions of the [four navigation patterns](../guide/overview.html#ManagingMultiplePages): *Navigator*, *Sliding Menu*, *Tab Bar* and *Split View*. Therefore, we can extend them easily and make our own apps without worrying about the set up.
