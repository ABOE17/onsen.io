Building secure applications is a challenge you might face while developing Monaca applications.
Important data, such as payment information or personal files, are potentially dangerous if it falls into the wrong hands.
Today, we are introducing 3 ways to ensure the security of your applications' data.

#### Using KeychainPlugin


[KeychainPlugin](https://github.com/shazron/KeychainPlugin) provides native iOS secure storage for your data.
Downside of this is that this option is limited to iOS applications.

First, install [KeychainPlugin](https://github.com/shazron/KeychainPlugin) in Monaca. (require Gold Plan with Monaca)

After the installation, fill out necessary configurations in both iOS App Setting and Build Setting.
Build has to be done as an iOS application in stead of regular Monaca Debugger.
Note that you will be ask to provide your Developer Certificate in the Build Setting.

Also, provisioning registration is required when you build your application so create your provisioning profile in advance.

Below are snapshots of a demo application with KeychainPlugin.

If the key does not exist, null is returned.
If the key does exist, we can retrieve the data.

Now we can store important data, such as user tokens or user IDs, securely with the KeychainPlugin.


#### Using Server-Side

Another way is to return the data that are stored on the server side to applications.
In this case, you will use authentication (such as OAuth2) to establish connection to the server side.
Once the connection is established, the server side can return the required data to the applications.
One advantage is that even if some problem happens, you only need to handle the server-side (e.g. refreshing tokens).
As a trade off this method requires an Internet connection during the process.


#### Using Secure Storage

Monaca Enterprise plan offers Secure Storage. Secure storage can provide reliable access to your data for you applications.
It is provided by encrypting saved data on devices, preventing information leaks in the case of theft or loss.

#### Conclusion

Ensuring data security involves numerous steps. It is difficult.
We could have users log in every time they open the app, but it is certainly against user experience.
We should keep in mind the importance of the data we are handling and apply proper security options for those data.
