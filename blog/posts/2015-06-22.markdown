Dear followers, as many of you probably already know, this week, in San Francisco, the [Angular U Conference 2015](https://angularu.com/ng/) will be held. For those of you who never heard of it, Angular U is an Angular conference covering Angular 1.x, 2, TypeScript, ECMAScript 6, Web Components and more. That's why we couldn't miss this event!

[Andreas Argelius](https://angularu.com/ng/speaker/2015sf/andreas-argelius-32414), core developer on Onsen UI and Monaca, will attend the event and talk about "Angular + Cordova + Monaca = Killer mobile app development"!

From June 22 to 25, at Hyatt Regency, close to San Francisco Airport, AngularJS developers and enthusiasts will meet to discuss the recent technological trends for what concerns Angular and, most in general, web and mobile development.

Andreas talk will be on Tuesday 23 June, from 3:00 PM to 3:25 PM (GMT-7), at \_BALLROOM ABC Room (a live feed stream will be available on the event's website).

Here is a short preview about what Andreas will talk about:

<div style="text-align: center; font-style:italic; color: #a5a4a4; border-top: 1px solid #ccc; border-bottom: 1px solid #ccc; padding:30px; margin:30px;">Hybrid apps are mobile apps built using technologies we all love: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. They can be deployed on several different platforms while still sharing most of the code base. In this talk, some awesome tools for building, packaging and publishing your hybrid apps will be presented. We will also look into efficient ways of debugging your code on actual mobile devices and how to create a performant and beautiful user interfaces with AngularJS and reusable UI components.</div>
