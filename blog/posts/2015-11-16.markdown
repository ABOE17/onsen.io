We are happy to announce that soon will update Cordova to version 5.2. Therefore, we have prepared a guidance for completely migrating existing projects (with Cordova version 3.5 or 4.1) to 5.2.

<!-- more -->

### Monaca Support Policy for Cordova 5.2

* New projects will be automatically created as Cordova 5.2.

* You need manually update your project to migrate to Cordova 5.2. A backup of the project is automatically created before conversion.

* Once Cordova 5.2 is updated, you cannot downgrade to older Cordova versions.

### New Cordova Plugins

Two new plugins will be added into Monaca core plugins.

1) Whitelist Plugin: This plugin is used to enhance security configuration for the app. Please note that you cannot remove this plugin. This plugin only applies to Android platform.

2) Crosswalk Plugin: This plugin enables your application to use Crosswalk engine for Android devices.

### Other Cordova Plugin Changes

* All Monaca core plugins will be updated to the newer version.

* Monaca Enterprise plugins are not supported at the moment. We will support them soon.

* Monaca Bluetooth Plugin is removed from core plugins.

### Android Platform Changes

* Please use Monaca Debugger 5.0 for debugging Cordova 5 apps.

* Android Debugger and High Performance (Crosswalk) Debugger are integrated. Therefore, please debug Crosswalk WebView apps using Monaca Debugger. The debugger will automatically switch its WebView based on the project settings.

* Crosswalk version is updated from 13.42.319.11 to 14.43.343.25. You can now change the Crosswalk version in the plugin configuration (requires a valid plan).

* Cordova 5 apps require Android 4.0 or higher.

* Cordova Android platform is updated from 3.6.3 to 4.1.1, and API LEVEL is set to 22.

* Config.xml AppBackgroundColor has been discontinued.

* Debugger cannot simulate [Allow External Access URL] configuration in the Android settings.

### iOS Platform Changes
