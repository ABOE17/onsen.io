![Onsen UI and Vue.js](/blog/content/images/2017/Mar/onsen-vue.png)

This is it. The moment you've been waiting for. After months of grooming the Vue.js bindings to a sweet and stable spot, the Onsen UI team is happy to announce that our bindings for Vue.js are now available as a consistent product.

As the *Vue* community is growing bigger and bigger, if you were looking for the best mobile UI framework to build your Vue.js mobile apps with, look no further than this blog post. Just as simple, performant and powerful as *Vue*, keep reading to find out all about the added value Onsen UI can bring to your projects.

### What's first

First of all, in case you haven't heard of Onsen UI before or have doubts about what it can do for you, I welcome you to visit our [recently renewed website](https://onsen.io/). The recent changes allow for an easier adaptation to the framework for beginners. It also provides a much clearer guide for basic and advanced features, answers your FAQs and in general eases the understanding of Onsen UI as well as its bindings to Angular, React and of course Vue.js.

Regarding Vue.js, here's the [direct link](https://onsen.io/v2/guide/vue/index.html#vue-js) to its specific documentation. I'd also recommend you read our [previous post](https://onsen.io/blog/vue-2-onseui-beta-release/) at the time of the beta release, which describes some implementation details and links to a kitchensink application where you can *vue* pretty much all of the framework's components in action.

### What's new

From beta to final release we passed through a release-candidate version that changed a few things. The biggest change came along with the core move for the `<ons-input>` component, which has been split into `<ons-input>`, `<ons-checkbox>`, `<ons-radio>` and `<ons-search-input>`. So in `vue-onsenui` instead of writing `<v-ons-input type="checkbox">` you should now write `<v-ons-checkbox>` and similar for the `radio` and `search` input types.

This allowed for our custom directive `v-ons-model` to be dropped in favor of the original `v-model` for template data syncing. You can now simply use `v-model` for all your inputs. Also `<v-ons-input>` and `<v-ons-range>` elements now have a `model-event` prop so you can do something like `<v-ons-input v-model="something" model-event="change">` to bind the input model to the `change` event instead of `input`, for example.

Finally the `tabs` array prop of `<v-ons-tabbar>` now accepts a `props` property for each tab object, which allows an easier passing of props to each corresponding page component.

### What's up

So, all these changes reflect our efforts to bring to you a tailored API, simple and pluggable, that combines the best of Vue.js and Onsen UI and optimized for mobile Vue.js apps.

With this you can create not only the more traditional *Cordova* apps but also the futuristic Progressive Web Apps (jump [here](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) to find out more about those). Actually we have even created templates to start from for both cases, ignitable from your usual `vue-cli`. Just try:

```
// this command for a Cordova app
$ vue init OnsenUI/vue-cordova-webpack hello-world

// this one for a PWA
$ vue init OnsenUI/vue-pwa-webpack hello-world
```

Add that to a framework that consistently gives you high design quality, great tooling (be sure to check out [Monaca](https://monaca.io/) as well if you don't know it yet) and more resources like state of the art documentation, tutorials and sample apps. What other reason do you need to try the best UI framework for Vue.js **right now**?
