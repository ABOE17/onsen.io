We recently released Onsen UI 2.0, which is framework-agnostic, supports both flat and material design, offers a rich collection of UI components and is just beyond beautiful and performant. Whoever has tried it was mesmerised, and in order to continue great development and gain better community support, we need your help spreading the word. And we will award your efforts!

To help others get started with Onsen UI 2.0, we prepared a contest, by which we encourage you to take the lead within the hybrid app development community. Share your knowledge, teach a trick, or spread the word > and win a prize!

You can share your knowledge and thoughts about Onsen UI anywhere. You choose your length, type and format! You can cover the basics (Onsen UI descriptions, simple app tutorials, personal views or elementary facts), but you can also dive deeper and create complex tutorials and comparisons.
