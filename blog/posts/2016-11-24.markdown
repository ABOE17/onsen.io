The YouTube Jukebox app has been updated to Onsen UI 2.0 + AngularJS and now includes
a Material Design version. This app uses the YouTube Data API v3 to fetch
videos and display them in our hybrid apps. Learn more about the
included changes here.

YouTube Jukebox sample app was released some time ago for Onsen UI 1. It has
a tutorial about how to use the YouTube Data API v3 with AngularJS in Onsen UI that is
still completely valid for Onsen UI 2. You can [check it
out](/blog/onsen-ui-youtube-api-v3/) for more details.

## YouTube Jukebox

The source code of this application is [on
Github](https://github.com/frankdiox/OnsenUI-YouTube).

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; margin-top: 20px;">
  <iframe src="https://frankdiox.github.io/OnsenUI-YouTube/" scrolling="no" style="width: 300px; height: 500px;  border: 0; box-shadow: 0 3px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.16), 0 3px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.23); margin-right: 10px" class="lazy-hidden"></iframe>
  <iframe
  src="https://frankdiox.github.io/OnsenUI-YouTube/?platform=android"
  scrolling="no" style="width: 400px; height: 500px;  border: 0; box-shadow: 0 3px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.16), 0 3px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.23); margin-left: 10px" class="lazy-hidden"></iframe>
</div>

After the latest changes it now includes a Material Design version that will
be displayed in Android devices. This version contains a modal that overlays a new
`ons-toolbar` which includes a search input. This behavior is quite common in
Material Design apps.

Another interesting change is that it now loads new videos when the scroll
reaches the bottom of the page using [`onInfiniteScroll`](/v2/docs/angular1/ons-page.html#attributes) functionality instead
of a "Load more" manual button.

This app is included in our [samples page](/samples) along with other useful
samples. If you have any doubt about this app, please leave a comment or open
an issue on Github.
