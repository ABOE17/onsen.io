I know I know, Monaca Team has been pretty quiet. Sorry about the lack of communication. We’ll try to be better. Lots going on!

One of the things we’ve been working on is to improve your **build** experience. And we are happy to release an update today. Woo hoo!

![New Build UI](/blog/content/images/2017/Jan/NewBuildUi.png)

Let’s go over the changes, shall we?

<!-- more -->

First thing you will notice is that the interface is revamped. Now there is a dedicated and streamlined page rather than bunch of popups and this interface is the same for IDE and the Localkit. No more confusion there.

Of course it is not just the look that changed. To build iOS apps, you can now manage secret key, certificate and provisioning files right inside Monaca.

The best part is that you can manage **multiple** iOS certificates and provisioning files. This allows you to specify which provisioning file to use for each project and for each build type. Localkit users can do this too.
 
You can also see build log in real time right there. Good to know what’s going on, right?


We hope this update makes the build much easier and more pleasant for you. Let us know what you think - we are always looking for your feedback. 
Be sure to let us know if you have any issue, request or whatever comment about Monaca.

Happy coding!
