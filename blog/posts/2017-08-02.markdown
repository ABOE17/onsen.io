Our development teams are proud to announce that applications created with Monaca can now use Cordova 6.5.
With the Cordova 6.5 support, many additional features will be available in Monaca, such as Android Nougat, iOS 11, the iOS library management tool "CocoaPods" as well as the Swift-made plugins.
In addition, once the Cordova 6.5 support is released, the Cordova version of all newly created projects will be 6.5.

### Cordova 6.5 Security

Compared to earlier versions, the security in Cordova 6.5 has been greatly enhanced. As a result, the restrictions on applications have become stricter than before and some functions that were running in previous versions, may not work in this one. For that reason, if the behavior of the app changes due to the update, please try to loosen up the CSP (Content-Security-Policy) by adding the following line in the `<head>` tag:

```html
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src * data: gap: https://ssl.gstatic.com; style-src * 'unsafe-inline'; script-src * 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'">
```

### Other notes

#### Downgrading a project

Updated projects can not be downgraded to previous versions.
As the backup of the previous version will be created automatically at the time of update, please use the backed up version if necessary.

#### Warnings about the store version debugger

In order to debug Cordova 6.5 projects, use the Monaca Debugger 6.5 or a custom debugger; otherwise, the projects may not work properly.
