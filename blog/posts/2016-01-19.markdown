![Monaca x Onsen Community](/blog/content/images/2016/Jan/onsen-monaca-community.png)

The new version of Onsen UI is coming and we are paving the way. We are happy to announce that the new [Monaca x Onsen UI Community Forum](https://community.onsen.io/) has been released! Many developers have requested a forum for Onsen UI and Monaca Tools where they could ask questions, share their progress, get community feedback and meet other developers. We hope you like it and join our brand new community!

<!-- more -->

We wanted a centralized approach where we could follow everything related to Onsen UI. Until now we offered support on Stack Overflow and Disqus for our blog and JavaScript reference pages. We are now moving all of this to our community forum where you can create new topics with "Ask as Question" option just like in Stack Overflow. Also all your comments in our blog and reference pages will be an extension of this new forum where you can use the same account. We will of course keep using GitHub issues for bug reports and also Gitter chat as a complementary service.

Don't hesitate to join us and post questions and feedback or show your own Onsen UI + Monaca app. You can already register [here](https://community.onsen.io/register). See you in the forum!
