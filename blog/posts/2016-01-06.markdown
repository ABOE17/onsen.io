### What to expect from this year's PhoneGap Day

[PhoneGap Day US 2016](http://pgday.phonegap.com/us2016/) will take place on Jan 28th and 29th in Lehi, Utah, at the Adobe offices. The PhoneGap team has organized 3 tracks of workshops and will bring you the best and most diverse content for every skill level and interest.

This year they are promising nothing less than "a killer lineup of speakers", as they're bringing worldwide community experts, ready to share their best tips and tricks to leverage your app success. Among them is also our CEO and founder [Masahiro Tanaka](http://pgday.phonegap.com/us2016/speaker/masahirotanaka/), who will hold a session about using Monaca Cloud to enhance Cordova Development. He will also lead a workshop about learning IoT programming, which you don't want to miss when attending the event.

### This year's special treat - Ski Day

All attendees are invited to wrap up the conference with a complimentary PhoneGap ski day at Utah's famous Sundance Mountain Resort. For those who are not too excited about hitting the slopes, they are offering a winter ziptour with breathtaking views of Utah's famous mountains, snowshoeing and world-class dining.

As the PhoneGap team is takes networking to another level, we're looking forward to meet Gary Meyer who created the [Ski Patrol Mobile App](http://www.skipatrolmobileapp.com/). How amazing it is too meet him on the slopes after he won the Monthly [App Ninja Contest](http://monaca.mobi/en/contest/)!? You can read more about him and his app in the previous [blog post](https://onsen.io/blog/ski-patrol-mobile-app-for-safe-joys-of-winter/).
