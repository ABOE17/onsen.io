Monaca CLI is a command-line tool which makes local development of Monaca apps easier. Recently, a new function called "transpile" has been added to Monaca CLI. It can be used to transpile code for React/Angular 2 apps.

We will explain in details about the `transpile` option.

## Installation of Monaca CLI

To use Monaca CLI, Node.js is required. After installing Node.js, use `npm` (or yarn) in the command prompt to install Monaca as follows:

```
$ npm install monaca -g
```

## Usage

Transpilation is used to convert languages like JSX (React) or Typescript (Angular 2) into something that can be executed by the browser.  If you want to create a project with React, select the category 'Onsen UI and React' and then choose the desired template as following:

```
$ monaca create react_monaca
? Choose a category:
  Onsen UI
  Onsen UI and Angular 1
  Onsen UI and Angular 2
❯ Onsen UI and React
  Ionic
  No Framework
  Sample Apps
```

A directory called `src` has been created. The React app source code has been stored in this directory.

```
$ tree src/
src/
├── App.jsx
├── HomePage.jsx
├── SettingsPage.jsx
├── main.jsx
└── public
    └── index.html.ejs

1 directory, 5 files
```

It is written as JSX as above. This could not be used as Monaca app without transpiling into ES5. Therefore, transpile is applied below.

### How to transpile

Running the following monaca command will transpile the code.

- monaca upload
- monaca preview
- monaca debug
- monaca remote build

Transpilation is performed automatically in Monaca CLI. To execute transpile alone, use the command below. Fonts, JS and stylesheet will be minified.

```
$ monaca transpile

Transpiling finished for /path_to/react_monaca
```

If the command is successfully executed, these files will be placed in the `www` directory. This means files are being generated to be used as a Monaca app. The only exception is `monaca preview`, which keeps the result in memory (instead of `www` directory) in order to speed up the development process.

Next, all you need to do is to create React or Angular2 App.

Gulp could also be used to transpile; however, it consumes a lot of time. In this case, we recommend using Monaca to create the hybrid app easily.
