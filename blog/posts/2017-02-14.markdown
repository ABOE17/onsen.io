# New Feature: Beta Distribution via DeployGate and HockeyApp

We’ve got another good news to share with you.

On top of the iOS App Uploader feature to distribute your apps via App Store,  Monaca now brings you the ability to manually deploy the apps to third-party distribution services. This way, you can distribute your app for testing before uploading to any app market. 

(If you'd like to automate this process, check out the limited release [Monaca CI] (https://monaca.io/ci.html))

The services initially integrated with Monaca are [DeployGate] (https://deploygate.com/)  and [HockeyApp] (https://hockeyapp.net/).  

To do this, just follow these 4 easy steps:

1. Go to  Config ‣ Deploy Services and configure deploy service accounts
    For detailed information on how to configure see:    
    https://docs.monaca.io/en/manual/monaca_ci/overview/#automating-deploy-services

2. Manually build an app for any selected platform (Android, iOS, etc)

3. Select a third-party service from the Deployment Services section, which will become available after the app was successfully built.

*Some more details:*
- You can deploy to multiple service providers per build 
- You can have more than one of the same service provider as long as the aliases are unique
- You can re-deploy when the deployment failed due to wrong parameter, for example.
- You can supply optional parameters in the configuration dialog.

We hope this feature is useful to many of you.
