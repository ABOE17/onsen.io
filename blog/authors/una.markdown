Before moving to Tokyo and San Francisco to support potential of early-stage startups in global markets, Una worked at Intel in Germany and studied Comparative Linguistics and Marketing in Slovenia.

Just like Monaca and Onsen UI, she loves diversity and freedom to choose own components and try new things. She is shifting her focus from classical to programming languages, reaching new markets and using all her free time driving pretty much any road vehicle she can get her hands on.

She enjoys multicore, multiplatform, limitless roadtrips.
