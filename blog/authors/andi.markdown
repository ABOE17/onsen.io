Andiâ€™s childhood interest in Data Management, Business Intelligence, Computer Security and discovering different cultures led his decision to study Computer Science and Engineering in Italy, France and Japan. What initially started as a short-term internship program in Tokyo evolved into life-changing decision to move to Japan and continue working on Onsen UI.

Just like with coding, Andi enjoys diversity in daily life. When he is not writing multiplatform code, he enjoys exploring multicultural environments, nice food and drinks with friends, watching movies and dramas, as well as capturing stunning photographs.

In addition to speaking quite a few languages (including newly acquired Japanese),  Andi speaks openly about his passion for soccer and motorsport.
