Andi is a programmer from Italy currently living in Tokyo. He has studied Computer Science and Engineering at University of Bologna, Italy. His passion for different cultures brought him to spend one semester at the University of Paris-Est Marne-la-Vall√©e in France, which made him even more motivated about discovering the world. He joined Asial Corporation and Onsen UI team as a winner of the Vulcanus in Japan 2014/15 scholarship, promoted by the European Union and the Japanese Government. After the scholarship period was over, he decided to continue to live in Japan and, with his big happiness, he was able to continue to work for Asial.

He likes to spend his free time traveling and getting in touch with new cultures, enjoying nice food and drink with friends, watching movies and dramas, reading, photography and, of course, learning Japanese. He is also a big sports fan, addicted in soccer and motors.

Even if the projects in which he is involved are related in Web and Mobile Development, he is also very interested in Data Management, Business Intelligence and Computer Security, which has fascinated him since he was a kid.
