After finalising his studies of Computer Engineering in Spain and Finland, Fran joined a student exchange program and Onsen UI team as an intern in Tokyo. This experience exceeded all expectations, therefore he decided to keep his hybrid Tokyoite lifestyle and coding projects.

He is an expert in delivering native look & feel, which he applies to both Onsen UI development, as well as his traditional kimono wearing practice.

Fran likes travelling and experiencing new environments. He also loves tomatoes.
