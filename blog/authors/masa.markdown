Masa

Masa founded Asial Corporation, the company behind Monaca and Onsen UI, immediately upon his graduation from Tokyo University. Already as a student Masa played an important role in Japanese developer community, writing PHP books and initiating meetups, and he still holds a pioneering and leadership role organizing main PHP, Cordova and hybrid app events in Japan and speaking at conferences overseas.

His management style shares characteristics of Monaca and Onsen UI: Efficient, stress-free, helpful and effective. 50+ Asial Corporation employees sometimes think he's a superhero, as he impeccably manages the work-life balance, being both an inspiring manager and a true family man. He enjoys spending his free time with his wife and 2 kids.

If Masa takes a day off, it means he is flying a small airplane around Japan or United States.
