Bryan started programming at the age of 13, passionate about gaming, computer security and forensics. He moved from Texas to Tokyo last year, excited about the comprehensive experience Monaca brings:

His daily life in Japan consists of universal hybrid mobile app development and thorough & deeper exploration of Japanese culture, entertainment industry and food. He never limits his love for diverse platforms and cuisines, therefore he enjoys exploring new technologies and exotic Asian food.
