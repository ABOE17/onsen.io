Andreas is a programmer from Sweden. He's been working in Japan as a JavaScript engineer on the Onsen UI team since 2014.

He studied engineering and mathematics at Lund University in Sweden. After graduating from university he worked for a couple of years in Sweden before deciding to move to Japan. The move was mainly motivated by a love of Japanese food and an interest in the Japanese language.

When he is not writing code, Andreas enjoys cooking and drinking beer.
