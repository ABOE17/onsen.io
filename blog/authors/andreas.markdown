After his studies of engineering and mathematics, Andreas worked as a programmer in Sweden. As he could not deny his love for Japanese food and language, he moved to Tokyo to enjoy the local lifestyle and lead the Onsen UI development team. 

He lives by the rule of speed and efficiency, which he applies to Onsen UI, as well as every running training. His team is very supportive of his framework and UI components projects, as well as his upcoming Yokohama Marathon participation.

When he is not writing code (or running away from it), Andreas enjoys cooking and drinking beer.
